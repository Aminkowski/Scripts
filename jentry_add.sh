#! /bin/bash
# idea: you run this on an entry, check it exists and all, asks you for the details of what you want to add.
# start time will be assumed from last entry.
#   print out what happened last for user so they know
# ask how long this new interval is > store and calculate new end time
# ask if one or more activities were performed during this interval
# if one then just add the activity attribute and ask what the activity was
# else end the tag, start a while loop and ask what the first activity is
# in either case you store the activity name and ask if they want to provide a description
#   in all likelihood I can prolly just enter while it's empty and use that instead of the overt asking
# if ya store description and make tag
# if it was multiple activities make it an activity tag and ask for the next. otherwise it's an interval and you just close that.
# end with multiple when they enter empty
